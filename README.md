This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

How to proceed: 

First, set up json-server on the localhost port 3000
To do that, either run json-server db.json (file is shared separately via the email)
Or, if json-server is not yet installed, npm install --save json-server
Important! In case your jspon-server is running on a different port, please change the BASIC_URL property of src/utils/constants.js


Clone the project using git clone <url of the repo>
Run npm install to install dependencies
Run npm start
As port 3000 will be already busy with json-server, acccept the proposed port (fpr example, 3001)
  
Enjoy!
